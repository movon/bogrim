# "Yedidey Hakfar Hayarok" organization's website.
We built it volunteeraly for our high school.
The server and the database run on AWS, same as the email service which we use SES + lambda for capturing and sending emails. therefore emails are almost totally free instead of using a paid email service such as gmail for organizations.

Server side is running on node.js.
If you want to run it locally, make sure you run app.js and not bin/www, configure webstorm that way, give it the app.js as the javascript file.

The website is running on http://www.kfar-yedidim.com.
